# Digit-Recognizer

This is a repository for the Digit Recognizer project. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately recognize handwritten digits from images. The dataset used in this project is the famous MNIST dataset, which contains tens of thousands of handwritten digit images.

*Requirements*

To run this project, you will need:

Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* Matplotlib

*Usage*

To use this project, you can open the Digit_Recognizer.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells sequentially. 

The notebook contains code for:

* Loading the MNIST dataset
* Preprocessing the data (e.g., scaling the pixel values, splitting into train/validation/test sets)
* Building a convolutional neural network (CNN) using Keras
* Training the CNN on the training set
* Evaluating the performance of the CNN on the validation and test sets
* Making predictions on new images


Results

The best model achieved an accuracy of 99.2% on the test set, which is a competitive result compared to state-of-the-art approaches on the MNIST dataset.
